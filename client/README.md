# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

TYPING SANDBOX




THINGS TO DO:
- fix all bugs that are going to appear for private rooms (DONEEEEEEEEE)
- fix bots for not signed in users (DONEEEEEEEEE)
- when private room leader leaves, it should assign a new leader
- some things in constant folder like API should probably be in .env
 


BUGS TO FIX:
- Sometimes typing text is not same for all users (DONEEEEEEEEE)
  * sometimes it doesnt even appear (DONEEEEEEEEE)
- Pressing next race for private race is completely bugged, and also it allows people that are not the leader to start new race...  (DONEEEEEEEEE)
- After user verifies and then signs in there is an error (DONEEEEEEEEE)
